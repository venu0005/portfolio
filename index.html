            <h2> My Portfolio</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my tiny world of Digital Arts, my portfolio. My idea of Digital art is where images come to life and words are represented via design. My name is Abhijith, and I'm a determined visual artist who decided to learn more about the dynamic industry of interactive media design. I'm thrilled to present my portfolio, a visual narrative that reflects my passion for design and the combination of technology and art.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in India, I began my career in Interactive Media almost 2 years ago, and I recently received my degree from Algonquin College's Interactive Media Design program, where I developed my love for merging technology and art. My path into the field of design began in my early childhood, driven by an intense interest in both artistic expression and technological devices.<br><br> My early determination with technology and design made me a techy nerd. This curiosity developed into a strong desire to investigate the fields of design, inspiring me to use digital arts as a means of bringing my concepts to life. I've built my career in this field by always staying eager to learn and striving for excellence.<br><br> I've become quite proficient with Adobe Illustrator and other programs, and I'm proud of the work I've done on my own. These activities demonstrate my dedication to being creative and unique. I constantly look for new, better, and easier ways to use digital tools in my work because I want to showcase my talent in digital arts to as many people as possible.<br><br> My objective is to bring out the new ideas and creative designs that everyone has in their mind but cannot present it to the real world, through digital arts, everything is possible<br><br></p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>Project 1 is the beginning of my career path in digital arts and is my first creative effort. It took many hours, nearly a whole day to get the basics down of Adobe Illustrator in order to complete this task. Although the path was difficult, I was proud and pleased when this was finished.<br><br><img src="images/Pro.png" alt="project 1 image"><br><br> This project represents the beginning of my digital arts experience. I overcame obstacles while navigating Illustrator's complications, making steady progress towards a satisfactory result. My future efforts were based on the sense of success I experienced from finishing Project 1.<br><br></p>
            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>This project was the turning point where i started to change my perpective towards designs rather than characters and objects, when I pushed beyond objects and characters this project served as my introduction to designing my own designs. Though there are some challenges with colour arrangement, I'm delighted to submit this as my first designer creation. <br><img src="images/pro2.png" alt="Project 2 Image"></p>
