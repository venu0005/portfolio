# portfolio

Here are some of the challenges and problems i faced when making my porfolio. Along with what i learned.

Making my web porfolio was a challenging yet fun experience for me. I implemented many things i learned throughout this semester.

# Some of the challenged i faced were :

Making sure my website was responsive, i had to get some help from google with bootstraps. Studying online resources and watching tutorials helped me get through this situation, although i could not complete to how i expected it to turn out.

# Things i have learned are:

I learned that i need to plan beforehand in order to make things much more easier. Not giving up and trying to look for help much sooner in order to acheive what i needed was also a good experience. Exploring the internet to find bootsraps and other examples adn hints also helped me manage to get more information about all this.

# Resources i used:
- Google for various examples from https://www.w3schools.com/ as well other wesites.

- Bootstrap: I used the Bootstrap framework for its responsive grid system and pre-styled components.

- GitHub Pages: My porfolio was published on Github.
